Step 2: Using the Playwright framework, you need to log in to the created account and write automated tests for the following scenarios:

    1. Navigate to the employee tab on the left-hand side of the panel and add an employee by filling in all the fields, including optional ones.

    2. Add another employee.

    3. Navigate to the employee tab and verify that both employees are displayed.

    4. Integrate this build so tests can run in the CI setup of your choice.

Please submit your project by uploading it to your git repository and provide us with a link to the project.
